  abstract    = "Beta retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the cat are classified
                 as either on-center or off-center, according to their response
                 to light. The cell bodies of these on- and off-center RGCs are
                 spatially distributed into regular patterns, known as retinal
                 mosaics. In this paper, we investigate the nature of spatial
                 dependencies between the positioning of on- and off-center
                 RGCs by analysing maps of RGCs and simulating these patterns.
                 We introduce principled approaches to parameter estimation,
                 along with likelihood-based techniques to evaluate different
                 hypotheses. Spatial constraints between cells within-type and
                 between-type are assumed to be controlled by two univariate
                 interaction functions and one bivariate interaction function.
                 By making different assumptions on the shape of the bivariate
                 interaction function, we can compare the hypothesis of
                 statistical independence against the alternative hypothesis of
                 functional independence, where interactions between type are
                 limited to preventing somal overlap. Our findings suggest that
                 the mosaics of on- and off-center beta RGCs are likely to be
                 generated assuming functional independence between the two
                 types. By contrast, allowing a more general form of bivariate
                 interaction function did not improve the likelihood of
                 generating the observed maps. On- and off-center beta RGCs are
                 therefore likely to be positioned subject only to homotypic
                 constraints and the physical constraint that no two somas of
                 opposite type can occupy the same position.",

                   reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance
                   to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike.
                   Though computational reproducibility seems more straight
                   forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex
                   and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes
                   being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious
                   challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code
                   developed for one research project cannot be successfully
                   executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review
                   current approaches to these issues, including virtual
                   machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then
                   examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines
                   several areas from systems research - such as operating
                   system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular
                   re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy,

                 plasticity at inhibitory synapses. We show that this mechanism

                 computer codes and a precise description of how the code was
                 applied to the data. A brief history of this approach is
                 presented first, starting with what economists have been
                 calling replication since the early eighties to end with what
                 is now called reproducible research in computational data
                 analysis oriented fields like statistics and signal
                 processing. Since efficient tools are instrumental for a
                 routine implementation of these approaches, a description of
                 some of the available ones is presented next. A toy example
                 demonstrates then the use of two open source software programs

                 manner across the surface of the retina. Indeed, the existence
                 of such regularity amongst a population of neurons, termed a
                 retinal mosaic, may be a defining feature of functionally
                 independent types of retinal neuron. We have examined the
                 spatial distribution of dopaminergic amacrine cells in the
                 ferret retina both in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and in the
                 ganglion cell layer (GCL) to determine whether the cells in
                 each layer form an independent retinal mosaic as evidence of
                 whether they should be considered as two separate types.
                 Ferret retinas contain approximately 1,900 dopaminergic
                 amacrine cells, of which 27\% are located in the GCL, and the
                 rest in the INL. Based on analysis of their Voronoi domains as
                 well as autocorrelation analysis and tests for complete
                 spatial randomness, we found that the distribution of INL
                 cells was statistically regular, while that of the GCL cells
                 was not. However, by using cross-correlation analysis, these
                 two groups of cells were found to be spatially dependent: an
                 exclusion zone was detected in the cross-correlogram of
                 roughly the same size as that found in the autocorrelograms of
                 both INL and GCL cells. Such a pattern would be expected if
                 dopaminergic amacrine cells in the INL and GCL were members of
                 a single regular population differing only in their somatic
                 depth. By using computer simulations, we tested this
                 hypothesis directly, confirming that a random assignment of
                 27\% from the total population produces cross-correlograms
                 that are indistinguishable from those of the biological
                 mosaics. We conclude, therefore, that the cells in the two
                 layers form a single functional population; those in the GCL
                 appear to be misplaced. Somatic positioning with respect to
                 depth within the retina is not, by itself, a reliable guide

                 that homotypic constraints within a type of neuron are
                 dominant, and that heterotypic interactions between different

                 Every neuron studied was found to be nonrandomly positioned:
                 Cells of a particular type were evenly spaced. However, all
                 cells were positioned randomly with respect to members of the

                 of avian cones and its adaptive significance. Here we show
                 that the five cone types of the chicken independently tile the
                 retina as highly ordered mosaics with a characteristic spacing
                 between cones of the same type. Measures of topological order
                 indicate that double cones are more highly ordered than single
                 cones, possibly reflecting their posited role in motion
                 detection. Although cones show spacing interactions that are
                 cell type-specific, all cone types use the same
                 density-dependent yardstick to measure intercone distance. We
                 propose a simple developmental model that can account for
                 these observations. We also show that a single parameter, the
                 global regularity index, defines the regularity of all five
                 cone mosaics. Lastly, we demonstrate similar cone
                 distributions in three additional avian species, suggesting
                 that these patterning principles are universal among birds.
                 Since regular photoreceptor spacing is critical for uniform
                 sampling of visual space, the cone mosaics of the avian retina
                 represent an elegant example of the emergence of adaptive
                 global patterning secondary to simple local interactions
                 between individual photoreceptors. Our results indicate that
                 the evolutionary pressures that gave rise to the avian
                 retina's various adaptations for enhanced color discrimination
                 also acted to fine-tune its spatial sampling of color and
                 luminance.",

  abstract    = "The R7 photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila retina are
                 ultraviolet sensitive and are thought to mediate color
                 discrimination and polarized light detection. In addition,
                 there is growing evidence that the color sensitivity of the R8
                 cell within an individual ommatidium is regulated by a genetic
                 switch that depends on the type of R7 cell adjacent to it.
                 Here we examine the organization of the two major types of R7
                 cells by three different rigorous statistical methods and
                 present evidence that they are arranged randomly and
                 independently. First, we performed L-function analyses to test
                 whether the organization of R7 cells (and the relationship
                 between them) is regular, clustered, or completely spatially
                 random. Next, we used generalized linear mixed models to test
                 whether the proportion of R7 cell neighbors differs from their
                 prevalence within the eye as a whole. Finally, we conducted a
                 series of simulations to test whether the proportion of R7
                 cell neighbors differs from that in a random simulation. In
                 each case, we found evidence that the organization of the two
                 types of R7 cells is random and independent, suggesting that
                 R7 cells in neighboring ommatidia are unlikely to interact and
                 influence each other's identity and may be determined
                 stochastically in a cell-autonomous manner. Compared with
                 traditional lineage or inductive mechanisms, this may
                 represent a novel mechanism of cell fate determination based
                 on noisy or stochastic gene expression in which the
                 differentiation of an individual R7 cell is a random event but
                 the proportions of R7 cell subtypes are regulated.",
