                 METHODS: THIRTY ADULT MICE (RANGE: 3-5 months) were
                 anesthetized and secured into the Bioptigen Spectral Domain
                 Ophthalmic Imaging System. Right eye SD-OCT images were
                 standardized by centralizing the optic nerve head (ONH) prior
                 to image acquisition. Global and quadrant total retinal
                 thickness (TRT) values were measured from retinal nerve fiber
                 layer to retinal pigment epithelial layer. Posterior segment
                 analyses also included the outer retinal layer (ORL) and inner
                 retinal layer (IRL). Further sublayer analyses of four layers
                 from the ORL and three layers comprising the IRL were also
                 performed. RESULTS: The overall mean±SD global TRT in a
                 C57BL/6 mouse model was 204.41±5.19 µm. Quadrant mean TRT
                 values were 204.85±5.81 µm inferiorly, 204.97±6.71 µm nasally,
                 205.08±5.44 µm temporally, and 202.74±4.85 µm superiorly.
                 Mean±SD thickness for ORL, and IRL were 126.37±10.01 µm, and
                 107.03±10.98 µm respectively. The mean±SD estimates for the
                 four layers of the ORL were 18.23±2.73 µm, 26.04±4.21 µm,
                 63.8±6.23 µm, and 19.22±4.34 µm. Mean±SD values for the three

                 understanding of the visual system at many levels, from the
                 developmental to the computational. It is important to be able
                 to relate different coordinate systems, e.g. maps of the
                 visual field and maps of the retina. Retinal maps are
                 frequently based on flat-mount preparations. These use
                 dissection and relaxing cuts to render the quasi-spherical
                 retina into a 2D preparation. The variable nature of relaxing
                 cuts and associated tears limits quantitative cross-animal
                 comparisons. We present an algorithm, ``Retistruct,'' that
                 reconstructs retinal flat-mounts by mapping them into a
                 standard, spherical retinal space. This is achieved by:
                 stitching the marked-up cuts of the flat-mount outline;
                 dividing the stitched outline into a mesh whose vertices then
                 are mapped onto a curtailed sphere; and finally moving the
                 vertices so as to minimise a physically-inspired deformation
                 energy function. Our validation studies indicate that the
                 algorithm can estimate the position of a point on the intact
                 adult retina to within 8° of arc (3.6\% of nasotemporal axis).
                 The coordinates in reconstructed retinae can be transformed to
                 visuotopic coordinates. Retistruct is used to investigate the
                 organisation of the adult mouse visual system. We orient the
                 retina relative to the nictitating membrane and compare this
                 to eye muscle insertions. To align the retinotopic and
                 visuotopic coordinate systems in the mouse, we utilised the
                 geometry of binocular vision. In standard retinal space, the
                 composite decussation line for the uncrossed retinal
                 projection is located 64° away from the retinal pole.
                 Projecting anatomically defined uncrossed retinal projections
                 into visual space gives binocular congruence if the optical
                 axis of the mouse eye is oriented at 64° azimuth and 22°
                 elevation, in concordance with previous results. Moreover,

                 patterns, exemplified by cone ``mosaic'' zebrafish retina, or
                 the regular arrangement of cone photoreceptor cells. We
                 consider the situation in which cells are arranged on a square
                 lattice and are initially undifferentiated. Later each cell
                 becomes one of the two differentiated states, affected by the
                 state of the neighboring cells. The cells that undergo
                 differentiation form a ``morphogenetic cell row'' which sweeps
                 from one end to the other end of the lattice through time.
                 This models an outward sweep of the margin of expanding mosaic
                 region of the retina which occurs as undifferentiated
                 photoreceptor cells become differentiated in concentric
                 circles, joining the mosaic. We introduce an index to measure
                 the ability of cell-differentiation rules to generate regular
                 checker-board patterns from irregular initial patterns, and
                 attempt to characterize the successful rules. We first show
                 the importance of six ``preservation conditions'' which
                 guarantee perfectly regular photoreceptor arrangement for all
                 the rows after a regular row. Then we select an additional six
                 ``optimizing conditions'' for responses to configuration that
                 are consistently shown by the rules of high average scores. We
                 also examine the effect of interaction between responses to
                 different configurations. Finally we examine the concept of
                 morphogenetic row precedence, i.e. that the successful rules
                 generating a high score tend to treat the consistency with
                 neighbors in the newly differentiated cells (those in the

                 according to two approaches, one based on the tensegrity
                 concept (a structure made of elastic and rigid elements), and
                 the other based on a simple model with viscoelastic features.
                 We have assumed causing deformation of their cytoskeleton,
                 overlap of dendritic areas and movement of the neuron.
                 Simulations based on these two models indicate that a random
                 distribution of neurons reaches an orderly configuration by
                 local and mechanical neuron interaction in the case in which
                 the cytoskeleton is modeled using the tensegrity approach, but
                 not when the neuron is modeled as a purely viscoelastic
                 system. Considering that the main structural difference
                 between the Maxwell model and the tensegrity model is that the
                 latter model contains rigid elements whereas the former does
                 not, this suggests that the presence of rigid components in
                 the cytoskeleton of retinal neurons plays a key role in the
                 formation processes of the retinal mosaic.",

                 regular manner so that the visual scene is uniformly sampled.
                 Several mechanisms are thought to be involved in the
                 development of regular cellular positioning. One early-acting
                 mechanism is the lateral inhibition of neighbouring cells from
                 acquiring the same fate, mediated by Delta-Notch signalling.
                 We have used computer modelling to test whether lateral
                 inhibition might transform an initial population of
                 undifferentiated cells into more regular populations of two
                 types of differentiated cells. Initial undifferentiated cells
                 were positioned randomly, subject only to a minimal distance
                 constraint. Each undifferentiated cell then acquired either
                 primary or secondary fate using one of several lateral
                 inhibition mechanisms. Mosaic regularity was assessed using
                 the regularity index and the packing factor. We found that for
                 irregular undifferentiated mosaics, the arrangement of
                 resulting primary (but not secondary) fate cells was more
                 regular than in the initial undifferentiated population.
                 However, for regular undifferentiated mosaics, no further
                 increases in the regularity of the primary fate mosaics were
                 observed. We have used this model to test the specific
                 hypothesis that on- and off-centre retinal ganglion cells
                 emerge from an initial, irregular undifferentiated population
                 of ganglion cells. Lateral inhibition can subdivide an
                 initially irregular population into two types of cell that are
                 mildly regular. However, lateral inhibition alone is
                 insufficient to produce mosaics of the same regularity as
                 observed experimentally. Likewise, and in contrast to earlier
                 reports, cell death alone is insufficient to match the
                 regularity of experimental mosaics. We conclude that lateral
                 inhibition can transform irregular distributions into regular
                 mosaics, upon which subsequent processes (such as lateral cell
                 movement or cell death) can further refine mosaic regularity.",

                 The forces underlying this lateral cell movement are currently
                 unknown. We have used a model of neurite outgrowth combined
                 with cell movement to investigate the hypothesis that lateral
                 cell movement is guided by dendritic interactions. We have
                 assumed that cells repel each other in proportion to the
                 degree of dendritic overlap between neighbouring cells. Our
                 results first show that small cell movements are sufficient to
                 transform random cell distributions into regular mosaics, and
                 that all cells within the population move. When dendritic
                 fields are allowed to grow, the model produces regular mosaics
                 across all cell densities tested. We also find that the model
                 can produce constant coverage of visual space over varying
                 cell densities. However, if dendritic field sizes are fixed,
                 mosaic regularity is proportional to the cell density and
                 dendritic field size. Our model suggests that dendritic
                 mechanisms may therefore provide sufficient information for
                 rearrangement of cells into regular mosaics. We conclude by
                 mentioning possible future experiments that might suggest

                 the role of activity-mediated ganglion cell death in the
                 formation of such cellular patterns. Because direct measures
                 of ganglion cell mosaics are problematic in the developing
                 retina, we examined the distributions of ON and OFF alpha
                 cells in the postnatal cat retina by assessing the degree to
                 which cells in closest proximity were of opposite sign (i.e.,
                 ON-OFF pairs). Computer simulations demonstrated that
                 superimposition of two regular distributions results in a high
                 incidence (approximately 90\%) of opposite sign pairs. This is
                 also the case for ON and OFF alpha cells in the mature retina,
                 reflecting the high degree of regularity exhibited by this
                 cell class. In contrast, during the first postnatal month,
                 alpha cells displayed a much lower incidence of opposite sign
                 pairs (approximately 60\%), comparable to the superimposition
                 of two simulated random distributions. We also show that there
                 is a 20\% loss of alpha cells in the central retina during
                 postnatal development and that this magnitude of loss is
                 sufficient to form regular distributions of ON and OFF cells.
                 To assess the influence of sodium voltage-gated activity on
                 this developmental process, intraocular injections of
                 tetrodotoxin (TTX) were made during the postnatal period of
                 alpha cell loss. When the TTX-treated animals reached
                 maturity, there was a dose-related decrease in the incidence
                 of opposite sign pairs, without any appreciable change in cell
                 density. Moreover, the regularity index of ON and OFF cells
                 was significantly lower than normal in the TTX-treated
                 retinas. These findings demonstrate that a spatially selective
                 pattern of ganglion cell loss contributes to the formation of
                 regular ON and OFF ganglion cell distributions and that such
                 cell loss is regulated by retinal activity.",

                 commonly attributed to fate determination mechanisms operating
                 around the time of cell birth, an hypothesis presuming that
                 the position of a nerve cell is fixed within the plane of the
                 retina from the time of its determination. At odds with this
                 view, recent results from X-inactivation mosaic mice indicate
                 that certain classes of retinal nerve cell, those known to
                 form orderly mosaics in the adult retina, disperse
                 tangentially during development. Furthermore, studies defining
                 the spatial characteristics of developing and mature retinal
                 mosaics suggest that cell-cell interactions around the time of

                 type, invariant across the retina, and accounting for the

                 mosaics independently tile the retina to ensure efficient
                 sampling of visual space. A recent theoretical model
                 represented the on- and off-center mosaics by noisy hexagonal
                 lattices of slightly different density. When the two lattices
                 are overlaid, long-range Moir\'{e} interference patterns are
                 generated. These Moir\'{e} interference patterns have been
                 suggested to drive the formation of highly structured
                 orientation maps in visual cortex. Here, we show that noisy
                 hexagonal lattices do not capture the spatial statistics of
                 parasol cell mosaics. An alternative model based upon local
                 exclusion zones, termed as the pairwise interaction point
                 process (PIPP) model, generates patterns that are
                 statistically indistinguishable from parasol cell mosaics. A
                 key difference between the PIPP model and the hexagonal
                 lattice model is that the PIPP model does not generate
                 Moir\'{e} interference patterns, and hence stimulated
                 orientation maps do not show any hexagonal structure. Finally,
                 we estimate the spatial extent of spatial correlations in
                 parasol cell mosaics to be only 200-350 $\mu$m, far less than
                 that required to generate Moir\'{e} interference. We conclude
                 that parasol cell mosaics are too disordered to drive the

                 preferentially express D1 (D1R) and D2 (D2R) dopamine
                 receptors, respectively. It is generally assumed that these
                 neurons are physically intermingled, without cytoarchitectural

                 this question we used BAC transgenic mice expressing enhanced
                 green fluorescence (EGFP) under the control of Drd1a or Drd2
                 promoter and spatial point pattern statistics. We demonstrate
                 that D1R- and D2R-expressing MSNs are randomly distributed in
                 most of the dorsal striatum, whereas a specific region in the
                 caudal striatum, adjacent to the GPe, lacks neurons expressing
                 markers for indirect pathway neurons. This area comprises
                 almost exclusively D1R-expressing MSNs. These neurons receive
                 excitatory inputs from the primary auditory cortex and the
                 medial geniculate thalamic nucleus and a rich dopamine
                 innervation. This area contains cholinergic and GABAergic
                 interneurons but apparently no D2R/A2aR modulation because no
                 fluorescence was detected in the neuropil of Drd2-EGFP or
                 Drd2-Cre, and Adora-Cre BAC transgenic mice crossed with

                 preproenkephalin. Altogether, the differences observed in
                 D1R-MSNs, D2R-MSNs, and interneurons densities, as well as the
                 anatomical segregation of D1R- and D2R/A2aR-expressing MSNs

                 of a set of points as a function of the distance of each of
                 those points from all the others. It is based upon a
                 two-dimensional point autocorrelogram. If the points are
                 randomly distributed, then the profile is flat, with a value
                 equal to the mean spatial density. Thus, any deviation from
                 this value indicates that the presence of the object
                 represented by the point alters the probability of
                 encountering nearby objects of the same set. Increased value
                 near an object indicates clustering, decreased value near an
                 object indicates anticlustering. The method appears to be
                 unique in its ability to provide quantitative measures of the
                 anticlustered state. Two examples are presented. The first is
                 based upon a sample of the distribution of the somata of
                 starburst amacrine cells in the macaque retina; the second is
                 based upon the distribution of the terminal enlargements on
                 the dendrites of a single macaque ganglion cell that projects
                 to the superior colliculus. In both cases, the density
                 recovery profile is initially lower than the mean density, and
                 increases up to the plateau at the value of the mean density.
                 Two useful measures can be derived from this profile: an
                 intensive parameter termed the effective radius, which
                 quantifies the extent of the region of decreased probability
                 and is insensitive to random undersampling of the underlying
                 distribution, and an extensive parameter termed the packing
                 factor, which quantifies the degree of packing possible for a
                 given effective radius, and is insensitive to scaling. An
                 extension of this method, applicable to correlations between
                 two superimposed distributions, and based upon a
                 two-dimensional point cross-correlogram, is also described.",

                 nearest-neighbor distance (NND). The commonest indicator of
                 regularity has been the ratio of the mean NND to the standard
                 deviation, here termed the 'conformity ratio.' However, an
                 accurate baseline value of this ratio for bounded random
                 samples has never been determined; nor was its sampling
                 distribution known, making it impossible to test its
                 significance. Instead, significance was assessed from
                 goodness-of-fit to a Rayleigh distribution, or from another
                 ratio, that of the observed mean NND to an expected mean
                 predicted by theory, termed the dispersion index. Neither
                 approach allows for boundary effects that are common in
                 experimental mosaics. Equally common are 'missing' neurons,

                 address these deficiencies, random patterns and real neuronal
                 mosaics were analyzed statistically. Ns independent

                 ratio 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 to examine the influence of sample
                 geometry. NND distributions, conformity ratios, and dispersion
                 indices were computed for the resulting 45,997 independent
                 random patterns. From these, empirical sampling distributions
                 and critical values were determined. NND distributions for
                 small-to-medium, bounded, random populations were shown to
                 differ significantly from Rayleigh distributions. Thus,
                 goodness-of-fit tests are invalid for most experimental
                 mosaics. Charts are presented from which the significance of
                 conformity ratios or dispersion indices can be read directly.
                 The conformity ratio reacts conservatively to extremes of
                 sample geometry, and provides a useful and safe test. The
                 dispersion index is nonconservative, making its use
                 problematic. Tests based on the theoretical distribution of
                 the dispersion index are unreliable for all but the largest
                 samples. Random deletions were also made from 33 real retinal
                 ganglion cell mosaics. The mean NND, conformity ratio, and
                 dispersion index were determined for each original mosaic and
                 36 independent samples at each of nine sampling levels,
                 retaining between 90\% and 10\% of the original population. An
                 exclusion radius, based on a spatial autocorrelogram, was also
                 calculated for each of these 10,725 mosaic samples. The mean
                 NND was moderately insensitive to undersampling, rising
                 smoothly. The exclusion radius was remarkably insensitive. The
                 conformity ratio and dispersion index fell steeply, sometimes
                 failing to reach significance while half of the cells still
                 remained. For the same 33 original mosaics, linear regression
                 showed the exclusion radius to be 62 +/- 3\% of the mean NND.",

  abstract    = "Retinal neurons are often arranged as non-random distributions
                 called ``mosaics,'' as their somata minimize proximity to
                 neighboring cells of the same type. The horizontal cells serve
                 as an example of such a mosaic, but little is known about the
                 developmental mechanisms that underlie their patterning. To
                 identify genes involved in this process, we have used three
                 different spatial statistics to assess the patterning of the
                 horizontal cell mosaic across a panel of genetically distinct
                 recombinant inbred strains. To avoid the confounding effect of
                 cell density, which varies twofold across these different
                 strains, we computed the ``real/random regularity ratio,''
                 expressing the regularity of a mosaic relative to a randomly
                 distributed simulation of similarly sized cells. To test
                 whether this latter statistic better reflects the variation in
                 biological processes that contribute to horizontal cell
                 spacing, we subsequently compared the genomic linkage for each
                 of these two traits, the regularity index, and the real/random
                 regularity ratio, each computed from the distribution of
                 nearest neighbor (NN) distances and from the Voronoi domain
                 (VD) areas. Finally, we compared each of these analyses with
                 another index of patterning, the packing factor. Variation in
                 the regularity indexes, as well as their real/random
                 regularity ratios, and the packing factor, mapped quantitative
                 trait loci to the distal ends of Chromosomes 1 and 14. For the
                 NN and VD analyses, we found that the degree of linkage was
                 greater when using the real/random regularity ratio rather
                 than the respective regularity index. Using informatic
                 resources, we narrowed the list of prospective genes
                 positioned at these two intervals to a small collection of six
                 genes that warrant further investigation to determine their

                 profile (DRP). Blue cones had been shown previously to have a

                 retina was labeled with antisera that recognize
                 glycine-extended cholecystokinin precursors. The labeled
                 bipolar cells were found throughout the retina and had
                 dendrites contacting a subpopulation of cone pedicles and
                 axons ramifying in the fifth stratum of the inner plexiform
                 layer. Several lines of evidence indicate that the labeled
                 bipolar cells are a single type despite some variations in
                 their morphology. First, the density of perikarya and their
                 diameters varied continuously as a function of eccentricity.
                 Second, the positions of perikarya within the inner nuclear
                 layer and the level at which the axons branched in the inner
                 plexiform layer were constant at all eccentricities. Bipolar
                 cells with similar morphology have been described previously
                 as ``blue cone bipolar cells'' (Mariani, 1984b), but there was
                 no direct evidence that this was the case. In this study, we
                 show by light microscopy that labeled bipolar cells have
                 dendrites ending exclusively upon presumptive blue cones
                 labeled by Procion black dye. All blue cones were contacted by
                 labeled bipolar cells, and virtually all bipolar cells
                 contacted blue cones, the only exceptions being in regions
                 where blue cones had been lost. Approximately 20\% more
                 labeled bipolar cells than blue cones were found at every
                 eccentricity; thus, connections between blue cones and labeled
                 bipolar cells were not strictly one to one. The mean number of
                 cones presynaptic to each bipolar cell was 1.2, and the mean
                 number of bipolar cells postsynaptic to each cone was 1.8. By
                 an electron microscopic study of labeled bipolar cell
                 dendrites, we determined that they became central elements of
                 ribbon synapses in blue cones. Some of their ribbon synapses
                 were unusual: in one type, a single, large labeled dendrite
                 was postsynaptic to two or more ribbons, while in the other
                 type, ribbons had two or more central elements. The presence
                 of these invaginating contacts and the axonal terminals in the
                 proximal inner plexiform layer suggest that the labeled
                 bipolar cells depolarize to short-wavelength stimuli and
                 function to relay information from blue cones to the inner
                 plexiform layer. There were also other, unlabeled bipolar cell
                 dendrites that received inputs from blue cones at basal
                 junctions and triad-associated flat contacts, which suggests
                 that there are additional types of bipolar cells conveying
                 information from short-wavelength cones in the primate retina.",

                 as either on-center or off-center, according to their response
                 to light. The cell bodies of these on- and off-center RGCs are
                 spatially distributed into regular patterns, known as retinal
                 mosaics. In this paper, we investigate the nature of spatial
                 dependencies between the positioning of on- and off-center
                 RGCs by analysing maps of RGCs and simulating these patterns.
                 We introduce principled approaches to parameter estimation,
                 along with likelihood-based techniques to evaluate different
                 hypotheses. Spatial constraints between cells within-type and
                 between-type are assumed to be controlled by two univariate
                 interaction functions and one bivariate interaction function.
                 By making different assumptions on the shape of the bivariate
                 interaction function, we can compare the hypothesis of
                 statistical independence against the alternative hypothesis of
                 functional independence, where interactions between type are
                 limited to preventing somal overlap. Our findings suggest that
                 the mosaics of on- and off-center beta RGCs are likely to be
                 generated assuming functional independence between the two
                 types. By contrast, allowing a more general form of bivariate
                 interaction function did not improve the likelihood of
                 generating the observed maps. On- and off-center beta RGCs are
                 therefore likely to be positioned subject only to homotypic
                 constraints and the physical constraint that no two somas of

                   reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance
                   to computer systems researchers and domain scientists alike.
                   Though computational reproducibility seems more straight
                   forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex
                   and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes
                   being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious
                   challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code
                   developed for one research project cannot be successfully
                   executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review
                   current approaches to these issues, including virtual
                   machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then
                   examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines
                   several areas from systems research - such as operating
                   system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular
                   re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy,

                 is now called reproducible research in computational data
                 analysis oriented fields like statistics and signal

                 manner across the surface of the retina. Indeed, the existence
                 of such regularity amongst a population of neurons, termed a
                 retinal mosaic, may be a defining feature of functionally
                 independent types of retinal neuron. We have examined the
                 spatial distribution of dopaminergic amacrine cells in the
                 ferret retina both in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and in the
                 ganglion cell layer (GCL) to determine whether the cells in
                 each layer form an independent retinal mosaic as evidence of
                 whether they should be considered as two separate types.
                 Ferret retinas contain approximately 1,900 dopaminergic
                 amacrine cells, of which 27\% are located in the GCL, and the
                 rest in the INL. Based on analysis of their Voronoi domains as
                 well as autocorrelation analysis and tests for complete
                 spatial randomness, we found that the distribution of INL
                 cells was statistically regular, while that of the GCL cells
                 was not. However, by using cross-correlation analysis, these
                 two groups of cells were found to be spatially dependent: an
                 exclusion zone was detected in the cross-correlogram of
                 roughly the same size as that found in the autocorrelograms of
                 both INL and GCL cells. Such a pattern would be expected if
                 dopaminergic amacrine cells in the INL and GCL were members of
                 a single regular population differing only in their somatic
                 depth. By using computer simulations, we tested this
                 hypothesis directly, confirming that a random assignment of
                 27\% from the total population produces cross-correlograms
                 that are indistinguishable from those of the biological
                 mosaics. We conclude, therefore, that the cells in the two
                 layers form a single functional population; those in the GCL
                 appear to be misplaced. Somatic positioning with respect to
                 depth within the retina is not, by itself, a reliable guide

                 formation of these mosaics. Most evidence to date suggests
                 that homotypic constraints within a type of neuron are
                 dominant, and that heterotypic interactions between different
                 types of neuron are rare. In an analysis of macaque H1 and H2

                 Every neuron studied was found to be nonrandomly positioned:
                 Cells of a particular type were evenly spaced. However, all
                 cells were positioned randomly with respect to members of the

                 photoreceptor systems among vertebrates. Birds have five types
                 of cones including four single cones, which support
                 tetrachromatic color vision and a double cone, which is
                 thought to mediate achromatic motion perception. Despite this
                 richness, very little is known about the spatial organization
                 of avian cones and its adaptive significance. Here we show
                 that the five cone types of the chicken independently tile the
                 retina as highly ordered mosaics with a characteristic spacing
                 between cones of the same type. Measures of topological order
                 indicate that double cones are more highly ordered than single
                 cones, possibly reflecting their posited role in motion
                 detection. Although cones show spacing interactions that are
                 cell type-specific, all cone types use the same
                 density-dependent yardstick to measure intercone distance. We
                 propose a simple developmental model that can account for
                 these observations. We also show that a single parameter, the
                 global regularity index, defines the regularity of all five
                 cone mosaics. Lastly, we demonstrate similar cone
                 distributions in three additional avian species, suggesting
                 that these patterning principles are universal among birds.
                 Since regular photoreceptor spacing is critical for uniform
                 sampling of visual space, the cone mosaics of the avian retina
                 represent an elegant example of the emergence of adaptive
                 global patterning secondary to simple local interactions
                 between individual photoreceptors. Our results indicate that
                 the evolutionary pressures that gave rise to the avian
                 retina's various adaptations for enhanced color discrimination

  abstract    = "The R7 photoreceptor cells of the Drosophila retina are
                 ultraviolet sensitive and are thought to mediate color
                 discrimination and polarized light detection. In addition,
                 there is growing evidence that the color sensitivity of the R8
                 cell within an individual ommatidium is regulated by a genetic
                 switch that depends on the type of R7 cell adjacent to it.
                 Here we examine the organization of the two major types of R7
                 cells by three different rigorous statistical methods and
                 present evidence that they are arranged randomly and
                 independently. First, we performed L-function analyses to test
                 whether the organization of R7 cells (and the relationship
                 between them) is regular, clustered, or completely spatially
                 random. Next, we used generalized linear mixed models to test
                 whether the proportion of R7 cell neighbors differs from their
                 prevalence within the eye as a whole. Finally, we conducted a
                 series of simulations to test whether the proportion of R7
                 cell neighbors differs from that in a random simulation. In
                 each case, we found evidence that the organization of the two
                 types of R7 cells is random and independent, suggesting that
                 R7 cells in neighboring ommatidia are unlikely to interact and
                 influence each other's identity and may be determined
                 stochastically in a cell-autonomous manner. Compared with
                 traditional lineage or inductive mechanisms, this may
                 represent a novel mechanism of cell fate determination based
                 on noisy or stochastic gene expression in which the
                 differentiation of an individual R7 cell is a random event but
                 the proportions of R7 cell subtypes are regulated.",
