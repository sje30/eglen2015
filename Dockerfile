## 2018-08-05
## Since writing the Dockerfile in 2016, rocker/verse has switched to
## using the new "tinytex" package for installing latex packages on
## the fly.  On the plus-side, it means that I don't need to tweak
## with the latex to get extra packages.  Another bonus is that when
## running e.g. knit2pdf() if there are latex style files missing,
## they are automatically downloaded by R .  The downside is that the
## downloading of the style files takes a few minutes...

## I'm also not quite sure why I need to have the "USER root" line...
## and so I need to check why this is?  By default it seems that rstudio
## should have write access to the /opt/tinytex area, but see error below when running as rstudio user
